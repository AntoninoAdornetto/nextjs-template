# Preferred Next.js configs

## Info 
I tend to gravitate more towards Nextjs for front end projects, the only thing I dislike about using create-next-app is not having my source files set up in the src/ folder. This repo is a quick and painless solution. 

## Configs
- Typescript
- Jest 
- Absolute imports
- src/
